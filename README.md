# VKCommentDeleter
Deleting your VKontakte comments

You need to place the comments folder (you can get it by requesting an archive with the data: https://vk.com/data_protection?section=rules&scroll_to_archive=1)

1: Open CommentDeleter and enter your VKontakte token into the console (https://vkhost .github.io/)

2: If you have placed next to CommentDeleter.py the comments folder, you just need to wait (If there is no folder nearby, you need to write the path to the folder in the console). The deletion time depends on the number of html pages with your comments.
